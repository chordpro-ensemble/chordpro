{t:Nellie Kane}
As a [D]young man I went riding out on the western plain
In the state of North Dakota I met my Nellie [Bm]Kane,
I [A]met my N[D]ellie Kane

{soc}
I don't [G]know what changed my [D]mind 
'til then I [A]was the ramblin' [D]kind
The kind of [G]love I can't [D]explain 
That I [F]have[E] for Nellie [D]Kane
{eoc}

She was [D]livin' alone in a cabin with a son by another man
For five years she waited for him, as long as a woman [Bm]can,
As [A]long as a woman [D]can
